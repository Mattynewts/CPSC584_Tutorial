# CPSC584_Tutorial

This github aims to capture all the required material and documentation needed to be successful in Computer Science 584 - Human-Robot Interaction 

We will be using the Sunfounder PiCrawler kit throughout this class:

# Part 1: Building the robot Head
**Do not build the robot legs yet as we will want to install software and zero motors before doing so**

Before we can do any coding we need to first build the robots. Start using the included instructions with the kit. 
You can use this video if you are having trouble or need a reference visual:

# Part 2: Using EzBlock Application to Control to the Robot
**Important - EzBlock will not work if you are using a Raspberry Pi 5**
- If you are using a Raspberry Pi 5 you will need to follow the guide for using python to control the robot

## Software Setup Summary:
1. Install EzBlock OS to a micro SD card (https://docs.sunfounder.com/projects/ezblock3/en/latest/quick_guide_3.2/install_ezblock_os.html#install-ezblock-os-latest)
2. Zero the servo motors following steps from the following link (https://docs.sunfounder.com/projects/pi-crawler/en/latest/ezblock/quick_guide_on_ezblock.html -> you can ignore the plug in USB-C part since we are using the older Robot HATs. Just ensure your batteries are charged)


All the Software Setup Summary can be found in the documentation provided by Sunfounder:
https://docs.sunfounder.com/projects/pi-crawler/en/latest/ezblock/quick_guide_on_ezblock.html

This video also gives a run down of what is needed for this part:

# Part 3: Leg Assembly
Once the servo motors have been successfully zeroed you can carefully assemble the legs.
**Take care to not move servo motors once zeroed otherwise you will have to redo the zeroing**


## Key Building Notes:
1. Keep small screws and bolts organized
2. Ensure you correctly zero all servo motors
3. Attach the legs to motors at the correct angle
4. Manage your wires from the motors


# Part 4: Connecting to your robot and "Hello World" exercise
